# Job Application Tracker
A minimal, resume‑ready full‑stack app to track job applications. Built using FastAPI, React (Vite), Tailwind, and SQLite.

## 💡 Project Motivation
I built this project to help me keep track of the many job applications I was sending out. The process quickly became overwhelming, so I wanted a simple tool to organize applications, statuses, and notes in one place. At the same time, it gave me a fun opportunity to refresh my coding skills, revisit core concepts, and strengthen my memory by building something useful from scratch.

## 🚀 Features

Add, edit, delete job applications.

Fields: company, title, location, source, status, date applied, job link, notes.

Filter by status, keyword search (company/title).

Quick stats: counts by status.

Clean, mobile‑friendly UI with Tailwind.

REST API with FastAPI.

Deployable to Render (backend) + Vercel/Netlify (frontend).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite (swap with Postgres for production).

Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS.
